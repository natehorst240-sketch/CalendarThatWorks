/**
 * Resource pool schema — issue #212.
 *
 * A `ResourcePool` is a virtual grouping of concrete resources ("any
 * available driver", "any meeting room ≥ 8 seats"). Bookings target the
 * pool id; at submit time the resolver picks one concrete member using
 * the configured strategy.
 *
 * Three pool types (#386 v2):
 *   - `manual`  — static `memberIds` list (default; v1 behavior).
 *   - `query`   — candidates are computed at resolve-time by evaluating
 *                 `query` against the live `EngineResource` registry.
 *                 `memberIds` is ignored.
 *   - `hybrid`  — intersection: the candidate set is `memberIds` filtered
 *                 by `query`. Useful for "any of these specific assets,
 *                 but only the ones currently certified for cold-chain".
 *
 * Only the schema lives here. The resolver — which reads conflicts /
 * assignments to pick a member — lives in `resolvePool.ts`. The query
 * evaluator lives in `evaluateQuery.ts`.
