/**
 * Resource pool resolver — issue #212.
 *
 * Picks a concrete resource from a `ResourcePool` given a proposed
 * (window, event) and current engine state. Pure function — no side
 * effects, deterministic given identical input — so the submit-flow can
 * call it before holding or writing.
 *
 * Resolution is driven by the pool's `strategy`:
 *   - `first-available`: first member with no hard conflict on the window.
 *   - `least-loaded`: member with the smallest total assigned units in
 *     the window. Ties broken by member order (stable).
 *   - `round-robin`: cycles through members starting at `rrCursor + 1`,
 *     skipping any member that would produce a hard conflict. Returns
 *     an updated cursor so the host can persist it.
 *
 * Every strategy excludes members already in hard conflict — a pool
 * never resolves to a resource that would reject the booking anyway.
 * Soft conflicts (holds, min-rest warnings) do not disqualify.
