/**
 * Pool integrity check (issue #386).
 *
 * The resolver is happy to iterate a pool whose `memberIds` list points
 * at a typo or a since-removed resource — those entries simply produce
 * no overlap, so a `first-available` pool can return a "ghost" id as
 * the winning resource. Hosts that want to surface the drift at admin
 * time (rather than debugging "why does first-available always pick
 * the second member?") run their pools through this helper.
 *
 * Pure and stateless: pass a snapshot, get a report. The resolver also
 * accepts a `strictMembers` flag for the runtime variant — see
 * `resolvePool.ts`.
