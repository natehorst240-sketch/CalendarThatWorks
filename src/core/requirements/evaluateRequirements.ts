/**
 * `evaluateRequirements` — runtime consumer for the
 * `CalendarConfig.requirements` templates (issue #386 wizard slice).
 *
 * Pure / sync. Given an event, a requirements template list, and the
 * usual registry + assignment + pool maps, returns whether the event
 * is fully staffed plus a `missing` trail when it isn't.
 *
 * Match key is `event.category` (the engine's existing
 * "what kind of event is this?" field). The wizard / config layer
 * uses `eventType` as the same concept; the trip from one to the
 * other is a string match.
 *
 * Slot semantics:
 *   - `{ role, count }` — at least `count` assignments to this event
 *     must reference resources whose `meta.roles` includes `role`.
 *   - `{ pool, count }` — at least `count` assignments to this event
 *     must reference resources in the pool's effective member set
 *     (manual: memberIds; query: evaluateQuery; hybrid: intersection).
 *
 * Slots are independent — a single assignment can satisfy multiple
 * slots if its resource is tagged with the right role and is also
 * in the named pool. That matches the natural reading of "this
 * event needs a driver and a truck"; an Alice tagged as both is
 * still one body filling both.
