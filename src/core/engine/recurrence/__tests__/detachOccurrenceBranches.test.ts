/**
 * detachOccurrence — branch coverage supplement.
 *
 * The resourcePoolIdPassthrough tests cover the happy path with an rrule master.
 * This file covers the remaining two branches:
 *   1. throw when master has neither rrule nor seriesId
 *   2. short-circuit-false path when master has no rrule but HAS a seriesId
 *      (detached occurrences are allowed to be re-detached by this guard)
